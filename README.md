# Zalando_scraper
Simple stock zalando scraper written in python

## Libraries
You must install all this 3 libraries: requests, bs4 and dhooks. 

### Usage
To use the tool is very simple. If you run from your local machine, and your IP is good on Zalando you need to input the product url, your discord webhook and set "NO" to proxy status, this to run localhost.

If you need to run the script on a server, or with a banned IP, you can use the proxy support. Just leave the proxy status in "YES" and add a proxy list in the code where required. Make sure to input a list of proxies to be parsed next.

The proxy format must be "ip:port:user:psw", others are not supported yet.
